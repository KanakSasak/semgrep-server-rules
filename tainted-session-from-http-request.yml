    message: Detected input from a HTTPServletRequest going into a session command,
      like `setAttribute`. User input into such a command could lead to an
      attacker inputting malicious code into your session parameters,  blurring
      the line between what's trusted and untrusted,  and therefore leading to a
      trust boundary violation. This could lead to programmers trusting
      unvalidated data. Instead, thoroughly sanitize user input before passing
      it into such function calls.
