    message: This code contains bidirectional (bidi) characters. While this is
      useful for support of right-to-left languages such as Arabic or Hebrew, it
      can also be used to trick language parsers into executing code in a manner
      that is different from how it is displayed in code editing and review
      tools. If this is not what you were expecting, please review this code in
      an editor that can reveal hidden Unicode characters.
